## project_description

Ever since the advent of smartphones, the development of location-based services has been revolutionised. 
These services allow users to navigate to specific addresses or points of interest, such as universities 
or restaurants, by integrating the Global Positioning System (GPS) into various applications. GPS, a
satellite-based navigation system, provides a three-dimensional position, including longitude, latitude, 
and altitude, by utilising a network of 24 satellites, ground control stations, and user receivers.
While GPS offers high accuracy in open spaces, its reliability diminishes indoors due to weak or obstructed signals.
Therefore, alternative technologies such as WiFi access points, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons, and Ultra-Wideband (UWB)
have been explored for indoor positioning systems. Each technology has its advantages and limitations, 
with WiFi access points being chosen for their widespread availability and low implementation costs
despite the variability in network strength.
