Ever since the advent of smartphones, the development of location-based services has been revolutionised. These services allow users to navigate to specific addresses or points of interest, such as universities or restaurants, by integrating the Global Positioning System (GPS) into various applications. GPS, a satellite-based navigation system, provides a three-dimensional position, including longitude, latitude, and altitude, by utilising a network of 24 satellites, ground control stations, and user receivers. While GPS offers high accuracy in open spaces, its reliability diminishes indoors due to weak or obstructed signals. Therefore, alternative technologies such as WiFi access points, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons, and Ultra-Wideband (UWB) have been explored for indoor positioning systems. Each technology has its advantages and limitations, with WiFi access points being chosen for their widespread availability and low implementation costs despite the variability in network strength.
This report introduces the "Campus Navigation System (CNS) for the Visually Impaired," a project aimed at assisting visually impaired students at the University of Malawi in independently navigating the campus. The project aims to develop a mobile application leveraging Geographic Information System (GIS) technology for routing, real-time location tracking, and voice navigation to provide turn-by-turn directions. This document outlines the project's description, key requirements, technical details, progress schedule, and other pertinent information.
